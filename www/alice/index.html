					Once upon a time, in a curious land called Cyberspace, there was a little computer named Alice who stumbled upon a mysterious server. This was no ordinary server—it was a Web Server, a peculiar creature that lived in a house made of hypertext and bits, and greeted every visitor with a unique HTML page.

"Why, what are you?" Alice asked, eyes wide with wonder.

"I'm a Web Server," the server replied with a flourish, "Keeper of the World Wide Web. People from all over the globe send me requests, and I respond with the information they seek. It’s a never-ending tea party of data!"

Alice marveled at the Web Server’s ability to juggle requests from multiple visitors, serving each one as if they were the most important guest. She learned that every visitor spoke to the server in HTTP, a magical language of requests and responses, which the Web Server understood perfectly.

"But how do you manage so many requests at once?" Alice inquired.

"Ah, dear Alice," the Web Server chuckled, "I have threads and processes, helpers that allow me to handle many visitors simultaneously without losing my head!"

And so, Alice discovered the wondrous world of web servers—a realm where logic and connectivity ruled, and every request was an adventure in the land of code.
